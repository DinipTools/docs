As a Swetrix affiliate, you can earn money by promoting Swetrix on your website, blog, newsletter or social media accounts. We provide you with all the tools you need to become an affiliate and start earning commissions.

We pay 20% lifetime commission for every customer you refer to Swetrix through your affiliate link, directly to your PayPal account (as long as they remain a paying customer).

You don't have to be a paying customer to become an affiliate. You can sign up for free and start earning commission right away.

## How does it work?

On the [Account Settings](https://swetrix.com/user-settings) page under the 'Referral program' tab you will find your affiliate link. You can use this link to refer new customers to Swetrix. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, we will prompt the user with an option to set a cookie in their browser for 30 days.

If the user registers with Swetrix - they become your trial referral. If they then upgrade to a paid plan at any time in the future, you will receive a 20% commission for the lifetime of that customer.

:::note
We count commissions due for paid referrals at the start of their next billing cycle. If the customer cancels their subscription before the next billing cycle, you will not receive any commission for that customer.
:::

For example, if a customer signs up for a $50/month plan, you will receive a $10 commission for their first billing cycle when they pay for their second month. If they cancel their subscription before the second month, you will not receive any commission for that customer.

Each person you refer will receive a 20% discount on their first month with Swetrix.
