:::note
The easiest way to get started with Swetrix is by [using our cloud service](https://swetrix.com). We do all the dirty work for you: hosting, maintenance, backups, worldwide CDN, etc. Using Cloud you still own the data, you can export it or delete it at any time you want. By using Swetrix Cloud you support maintenance and development of the product, which eventually makes it better.
